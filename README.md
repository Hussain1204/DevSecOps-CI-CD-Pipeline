# DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline (IBM Certified Project)

A secure CI/CD pipeline designed and implemented as part of an IBM-led
DevSecOps certification program, focusing on automated security integration
across the software delivery lifecycle.

## Objective
To design a CI/CD pipeline that integrates continuous security checks,
container hardening, and automated deployment to reduce vulnerabilities
and improve release reliability.

## CI/CD Pipeline Flow
1. Source code management using GitHub
2. Continuous Integration using Jenkins
3. Static Code Analysis using SonarQube
4. Container Image Scanning using Trivy
5. Dynamic Security Testing using OWASP ZAP
6. Containerized Deployment using Docker and Kubernetes

## Tools & Technologies
- Jenkins
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- SonarQube
- Trivy
- OWASP ZAP
- Git & GitHub

## Security Outcomes
- Reduced security vulnerabilities by approximately 30%
- Decreased deployment errors by approximately 25%
- Improved delivery speed by approximately 20% through pipeline optimization

## Project Type
IBM Certified Academic Project (Group Project)

## My Contribution
- Designed and implemented the CI/CD pipeline
- Integrated static and dynamic security scanning
- Containerized application and configured Kubernetes deployment
- Performed vulnerability analysis and remediation

## Documentation
Detailed reports and pipeline screenshots are available in the `docs/` folder.
